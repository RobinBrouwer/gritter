This Ruby on Rails gem allows you to easily add Growl-like notifications to your application using a jQuery plugin called 'gritter'. [Check out the demo for this plugin](http://boedesign.com/demos/gritter/).

## Note

This is a Rails 3.1 gem. Are you using Rails 3.0 or lower? Check out [the 'old' branch on Github](https://github.com/RobinBrouwer/gritter/tree/old). Want support for IE6? 
Also check out that branch, because the newer version of gritter inside this gem dropped support for it.


## Installation

You can use this gem by putting the following inside your Gemfile:

    gem "gritter", "1.0.2"

Now generate the locale for gritter:

    rails g gritter:locale

Add the following to `/app/assets/javascripts/application.js`:

    //= require gritter

And the following to `/app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`:

    *= require gritter

And that's it!

## Changes

Version 1.0.2 changes (03/09/2012):
    
    - Merged pull request #22 (namespaced controllers gflash fix).

Version 1.0.1 changes (23/01/2012):
    
    - Fixed gflash(:js => true) in Ruby 1.9.2 and 1.9.3.

Version 1.0.0 changes (17/11/2011):

    - Gritter now only works in Rails 3.1. You should check out the 'old' branch for other Rails versions.
    - Removed everything that isn't needed for Rails 3.1.
    - Added new version for the gritter jQuery plugin (1.7.1).
    - Added position option for your gritter messages.
    - Locale isn't automatically generated. You need to use the gritter:locale generator.
    - Adding locale-based gflash messages got a bit easier.
    - You can now use a :gflash option inside the redirect_to method.
    - Using SCSS image_path instead of ERB image_path inside the CSS.
    - Added CSS3 support for gritter.
    - Refactored some parts of the gem.
    - Changed the README quite a bit.


## Usage

There are several helpers you can use with gritter. All of them print out Javascript code without script-tags.

    add_gritter
    remove_gritter
    extend_gritter
  
To add the script-tags we added another function called `js`. It allows you to easily add script-tags around your javascript.
It can be used in combination with gritter, but also other Javascript you want to run.

The most popular feature of this gem is `gflash`. This replaces the regular flash messages in Rails and 
automatically puts these in gritter boxes. Read further to learn more about gflash.


### add_gritter

The `add_gritter` helper allows you to add a gritter notification to your application. 
It outputs Javascript directly into your template. It works like this inside a `js.erb` file:

    <%= add_gritter("This is a notification just for you!") %>

The `add_gritter` helper allows you to easily set the text for the notification. 
When you want to change the title, just pass the `:title` argument to the helper:

    <%= add_gritter("This is a notification just for you!", :title => "Please pay attention!") %>

There are many more arguments you can pass to the helper:

    :title => "This is a title"            # => Allows you to set the title for the notification.
    :image => "/images/rails.png"          # => Allows you to add an image to the notification.
    :sticky => true                        # => Allows you to make the notification sticky.
    :time => 4000                          # => Allows you to set the time when the notification disappears (in ms).
    :class_name => "gritter"               # => Allows you to set a different classname.
    :before_open => "alert('Opening!');"   # => Execute javascript before opening.
    :after_open => "alert('Opened!');"     # => Execute javascript after opening.
    :before_close => "alert('Closing!');"  # => Execute javascript before closing.
    :after_close => "alert('Closed!');"    # => Execute javascript after closing.
    :nodom_wrap  => true 		           # => Removes the DOM wrap on the produced JQuery code. Default, this argument
                                                is false or not present, hence you always get a DOM wrap.

The `:image` argument also allows you to easily set five different images:

    :success
    :warning
    :notice
    :error
    :progress

It works like this in combination with flash[:notice] and the `js` helper:

    <%= js add_gritter(flash[:notice], :image => :notice, :title => "Pay attention!", :sticky => true) %>

The js helper is almost the same as the javascript_tag helper. The difference is that you can pass several scripts at once.
You don't need to pass these scripts as an Array. The helper also adds a linebreak (\n) after each script.

    <%= js add_gritter("See my notification"), add_gritter("Another one") %>

It puts all the scripts inside a single script-tag.

And that's it! You just added Growl-like notifications to your Rails application.
It's great for all kinds of notifications, including the flash notifications you want to show to your users.


### remove_gritter

The `remove_gritter` helper removes all gritter notifications from the screen. You can use it inside a `js.erb` file:

    <%= remove_gritter %>

You can pass two extra arguments to this helper.

    :before_close => "alert('Closing!');"  # => Execute javascript before closing.
    :after_close => "alert('Closed!');"    # => Execute javascript after closing.

You can also use the `js` helper to add script-tags around this helper.


### extend_gritter

The `extend_gritter` helper allows you to set the default gritter options.

    <%= extend_gritter :time => 1000 %>

These are the options you can pass to `extend_gritter`:

    :fade_in_speed => "medium"            # => Allows you to set the fade-in-speed. Can be String or Integer (in ms).
    :fade_out_speed => 1000               # => Allows you to set the fade-out-speed. Can be String or Integer (in ms).
    :time => 8000                         # => Allows you to set the time the notification stays. Must be an Integer (in ms).
    :position => :bottom_left             # => Allows you to set the position for all gritter messages.

The :fade_in_speed and :fade_out_speed options accept the following Strings:

    "slow"
    "medium"
    "fast"

The :position option accepts four different Symbols:

    :top_left
    :top_right      # Default
    :bottom_left
    :bottom_right

You can also use the `js` helper , add_gritter("Another one") to add script-tags around this helper.

### Using `nodom_wrap` to change the JQuery code produced

##### Default. (when nodom_wrap is not present)
The  `add_gritter` helper produces a JQuery code as below.

```ruby
 <%= add_gritter(:success, "See my notification")%>
```
 
 ```js
jQuery(function() { 
	jQuery.gritter.add({image:'/assets/success.png',title:'Success',text:'See my notification'
	})
});
```
 
##### nodom_wrap
 
 If you don't wanna wrap `jQuery.gritter.add({` inside a `jQuery(function()` then include the argument `:nodomwrap`

 The modified `add_gritter` helper with `nodom_wrap` is
 
 ```ruby
 <%= add_gritter(:success, "See my notification", :nodom_wrap => true )%>
```

With `:nodom_wrap` included, the following JQuery code will be produced.

 ```js
 jQuery.gritter.add({image:'/assets/success.png',
 title:'Success',
 text:'The product has been created successfully!'
 }); 
```

The argument can be included in `gflash` helper as well.

```ruby
gflash :success => { :value => "Account has been created!", :time => 5000, :nodom_wrap => true }

redirect_to signin_path(@user), :gflash => 
{ :success => { :value => "Welcome back #{@user.first_name}. 
Your email #{@user.email} is verified. Thank you.", :sticky => false, :nodom_wrap => true } }

```


### gflash

The `gflash` helper is a different kind of `flash[:notice]` message. It uses the `add_gritter` helper and the default images used in this plugin.
It uses a session to remember the flash messages. Add the following inside your controller action:

    def create
      gflash :success => "The product has been created successfully!"
    end

Now you can add the following to your layout view inside the body-tag:

    <%= gflash %>

The flash-message will be shown with 'success.png' as the image and 'Success' as the title.
To change the title you can add the following to the `gflash` helper inside the layout:

    <%= gflash :success => "It has been successful!" %>

Now the default title will be overwritten. You can also use gflash inside `js.erb` files:

    <%= gflash :js => true %>

The :success key isn't the only option supported by gflash. You can use the following gflash options:

    :success
    :warning
    :notice
    :error
    :progress

Each uses the corresponding image and title. You can also add multiple gritter notifications at once:

    def create
      gflash :success => "The product has been created successfully!", :notice => "This product doesn't have a category."
    end

Besides passing the exact text inside the controller, gflash also supports locales (both for messages and titles). 
When you start your server a new locale file will be added to /config/locales called `gflash.en.yml`.
Here you can set the locales for all your gflash messages and the titles. It works like this:

    en:
      gflash:
        titles:
          notice: "Custom notice title"
          success: "Success"
          warning: "Warning"
          error: "Error"
          progress: "Progress"
        products: # => Controller name
          create: # => Action name
            notice: "Custom notice message"

Now you can do the following inside your Controller:

    def create
      gflash :notice => true
    end

The locales for the `:notice` title and message will now be used. You can still pass a `String` to override a locale.
Since gritter version 1.0 you can also do the following to add the gritter messages:

    def create
      gflash :notice, :success, :error
    end

No need to pass `true` to each key.

You can change the default time, sticky and class_name options for each gritter message.
This is done inside the Controller and works like this:

    gflash :success => { :time => 2000, :class_name => "my_class", :sticky => true }
    gflash :success => { :value => true, :time => 2000, :class_name => "my_class", :sticky => true }
    gflash :error => { :value => "Custom error", :time => 3000, :class_name => "my_error_class", :sticky => false }

When you don't pass a `:value` it uses the locale. Same goes for when you pass `true` to `:value`. When you give `:value` a String, that String will be used to display the message. Here's another example:

    def create
      @user = User.new(params[:user])
      if @user.save
        gflash :success => { :value => "Account has been created!", :time => 5000 },
               :notice => { :value => "You have received an e-mail notification.", :sticky => true }
        redirect_to :root
      else
        gflash :error => { :value => "Something went wrong.", :time => 4000 },
               :warning => { :value => "Some fields weren't filled in correctly.", :time => 7000 }
        render :new
      end
    end

You can also use gflash directly inside the `redirect_to` method.

    def create
      redirect_to @post, :gflash => [:notice, :success]
    end
    
    def destroy
      redirect_to :posts, :gflash => { :warning => "You just deleted something important." }
    end
    
    def logged_in?
      redirect_to :login, :gflash => { :error => { :value => "You are not logged in!", :sticky => true } }
    end

And that's how you add gflash to your Rails application!
