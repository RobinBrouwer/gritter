# gritter

    version 1.2.0
    Robin Brouwer

This Ruby on Rails gem allows you to easily add Growl-like notifications to your application using a jQuery plugin called 'gritter'. [Check out the demo for this plugin](http://boedesign.com/demos/gritter/).

## Note

Are you using Rails 3.0 or lower? Check out [the 'old' branch on Github](https://github.com/RobinBrouwer/gritter/tree/old). Want support for IE6? 
Also check out that branch, because the newer version of gritter inside this gem dropped support for it.
If you are Using Rails 6 you should add manually the JS and SCSS to your path

## Installation For Rails 6
**Add gritter.js and gritter.scss to your packs .
  Do not forget to add images folder to your packs too. **
  Add this line to your application.js :
    
    import 'gritter';
    
Add this to your application.scss :
    
    @import 'gritter';


## Installation For Rails 4

You can use this gem by putting the following inside your Gemfile:

    gem "gritter", "1.2.0"

Now generate the locale for gritter:

    rails g gritter:locale

Add the following to `/app/assets/javascripts/application.js`:

    //= require gritter

And the following to `/app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`:

    *= require gritter

And that's it!

## Usage

There are several helpers you can use with gritter. All of them print out Javascript code without script-tags.

```ruby
add_gritter
remove_gritter
extend_gritter
```

To add the script-tags we added another function called `js`. It allows you to easily add script-tags around your javascript.
It can be used in combination with gritter, but also other Javascript you want to run.

The most popular feature of this gem is `gflash`. This replaces the regular flash messages in Rails and 
automatically puts these in gritter boxes. Read further to learn more about gflash.


### add_gritter

The `add_gritter` helper allows you to add a gritter notification to your application. 
It outputs Javascript directly into your template. It works like this inside a `js.erb` file:

```ruby
<%= add_gritter("This is a notification just for you!") %>
```

The `add_gritter` helper allows you to easily set the text for the notification. 
When you want to change the title, just pass the `:title` argument to the helper:

```ruby
<%= add_gritter("This is a notification just for you!", :title => "Please pay attention!") %>
```

There are many more arguments you can pass to the helper:

```ruby
:title => "This is a title"            # => Allows you to set the title for the notification.
:image => "/images/rails.png"          # => Allows you to add an image to the notification.
:sticky => true                        # => Allows you to make the notification sticky.
:time => 4000                          # => Allows you to set the time when the notification disappears (in ms).
:class_name => "gritter"               # => Allows you to set a different classname.
:before_open => "alert('Opening!');"   # => Execute javascript before opening.
:after_open => "alert('Opened!');"     # => Execute javascript after opening.
:on_click => "alert('Clicked!');"      # => Execute javascript on click (close button click is ignored).
:before_close => "alert('Closing!');"  # => Execute javascript before closing.
:after_close => "alert('Closed!');"    # => Execute javascript after closing.
:nodom_wrap  => true                   # => Removes the DOM wrap on the produced JQuery code. Default, this argument
                                       #    is false or not present, hence you always get a DOM wrap.
```

The `:image` argument also allows you to easily set five different images:

```ruby
:success
:warning
:notice
:error
:progress
```

It works like this in combination with flash[:notice] and the `js` helper:

```ruby
<%= js add_gritter(flash[:notice], :image => :notice, :title => "Pay attention!", :sticky => true) %>
```

The js helper is almost the same as the javascript_tag helper. The difference is that you can pass several scripts at once.
You don't need to pass these scripts as an Array. The helper also adds a linebreak (\n) after each script.

```ruby
<%= js add_gritter("See my notification"), add_gritter("Another one") %>
```

It puts all the scripts inside a single script-tag.

And that's it! You just added Growl-like notifications to your Rails application.
It's great for all kinds of notifications, including the flash notifications you want to show to your users.


### remove_gritter

The `remove_gritter` helper removes all gritter notifications from the screen. You can use it inside a `js.erb` file:

```ruby
<%= remove_gritter %>
```

You can pass two extra arguments to this helper.

```ruby
:before_close => "alert('Closing!');"  # => Execute javascript before closing.
:after_close => "alert('Closed!');"    # => Execute javascript after closing.
```

You can also use the `js` helper to add script-tags around this helper.


### extend_gritter

The `extend_gritter` helper allows you to set the default gritter options.

```ruby
<%= extend_gritter :time => 1000 %>
```

These are the options you can pass to `extend_gritter`:

```ruby
:fade_in_speed => "medium"            # => Allows you to set the fade-in-speed. Can be String or Integer (in ms).
:fade_out_speed => 1000               # => Allows you to set the fade-out-speed. Can be String or Integer (in ms).
:time => 8000                         # => Allows you to set the time the notification stays. Must be an Integer (in ms).
:position => :bottom_left             # => Allows you to set the position for all gritter messages.
```

The :fade_in_speed and :fade_out_speed options accept the following Strings:

```ruby
"slow"
"medium"
"fast"
```

The :position option accepts four different Symbols:

```ruby
:top_left
:top_right      # Default
:bottom_left
:bottom_right
```

You can also use the `js` helper , add_gritter("Another one") to add script-tags around this helper.


### gflash

The `gflash` helper is a different kind of `flash[:notice]` message. It uses the `add_gritter` helper and the default images used in this gem.
It saves the messages in `session[:gflash]`. It can also save the messages inside the default Rails flash messages (`flash` and `flash.now`). 
To do this, you have to add the following to an initializer: `Gritter.rails_flash_fallback = true`.

Add the following inside your controller action:

```ruby
def create
  @product = Product.new(product_params)
  if @product.save
    gflash :success => "The product has been created successfully!"
    redirect_to(@product)
  else
    gflash :now, :error => "Something went wrong."
    render("new")
  end
end
```

You can add `:now` to add the flash message to `flash.now` as well.

Now you can add the following to your layout view inside the body-tag:

```ruby
<%= gflash %>
```

The flash-message will be shown with 'success.png' as the image and 'Success' as the title when the product is saved.
To change the title you can add the following to the `gflash` helper inside the layout:

```ruby
<%= gflash :success => "It has been successful!" %>
```

Now the default title will be overwritten. You can also use gflash inside `js.erb` files:

```ruby
<%= gflash :js => true %>
```

The :success key isn't the only option supported by gflash. You can use the following gflash options:

```ruby
:success
:warning
:notice
:error
:progress
```

Each uses the corresponding image and title. You can also add multiple gritter notifications at once:

```ruby
def create
  gflash :success => "The product has been created successfully!", :notice => "This product doesn't have a category."
end
```

Besides passing the exact text inside the controller, gflash also supports locales (both for messages and titles). 
You can generate `gflash.en.yml` by using the following command: `rails g gritter:locale`.
Here you can set the locales for all your gflash messages and the titles. It works like this:

    en:
      gflash:
        titles:
          notice: "Custom notice title"
          success: "Success"
          warning: "Warning"
          error: "Error"
          progress: "Progress"
        products: # => Controller name
          create: # => Action name
            notice: "Custom notice message"case

It's also possible to add default gflash messages.

    en:
      gflash:
        defaults:
          success: "This is a notification"
          error: "Something went wrong"
          create:
            success: "Successfully created!"
            error: "Something went wrong. Please take a look at the form to see what went wrong."

Now you can do the following inside your Controller:

```ruby
def create
  gflash :notice => true
end
```

The locales for the `:notice` title and message will now be used. You can still pass a `String` to override a locale.
Since gritter version 1.0 you can also do the following to add the gritter messages:

```ruby
def create
  gflash :notice, :success, :error
end
```

No need to pass `true` to each key.

You can change the default time, sticky and class_name options for each gritter message.
This is done inside the Controller and works like this:

```ruby
gflash :success => { :time => 2000, :class_name => "my_class", :sticky => true }
gflash :success => { :value => true, :time => 2000, :class_name => "my_class", :sticky => true }
gflash :error => { :value => "Custom error", :time => 3000, :class_name => "my_error_class", :sticky => false }
```

When you don't pass a `:value` it uses the locale. Same goes for when you pass `true` to `:value`. When you give `:value` a String, that String will be used to display the message. Here's another example:

```ruby
def create
  @user = User.new(params[:user])
  if @user.save
    gflash :success => { :value => "Account has been created!", :time => 5000 },
           :notice => { :value => "You have received an e-mail notification.", :sticky => true }
    redirect_to :root
  else
    gflash :error => { :value => "Something went wrong.", :time => 4000 },
           :warning => { :value => "Some fields weren't filled in correctly.", :time => 7000 }
    render :new
  end
end
```

You can also use gflash directly inside the `redirect_to` method.

```ruby
def create
  redirect_to @post, :gflash => [:notice, :success]
end

def destroy
  redirect_to :posts, :gflash => { :warning => "You just deleted something important." }
end

def logged_in?
  redirect_to :login, :gflash => { :error => { :value => "You are not logged in!", :sticky => true } }
end
```

You can use i18n interpolation like this:

```ruby
redirect_to :root, :flash => { :success => true, :locals => { :name => @user.name, :email => @user.email } }
gflash :success, :info, :locals => { :name => @user.name, :email => @user.email }
gflash :success, :info => { :locals => { :name => @user.name, :email => @user.email } }
```

Inside `gflash.en.yml` you can do the following:

```ruby
success: "Welcome, %{name}."
info: "Your e-mail address has been changed to: %{email}."
```

And that's how you add gflash to your Rails application!


### Using `nodom_wrap` to change the jQuery code produced

##### Default (when nodom_wrap is not present)
The `add_gritter` helper produces JQuery code as shown below.

```ruby
<%= add_gritter(:success, "See my notification") %>
```

```js
jQuery(function() { 
  jQuery.gritter.add({ image: '/assets/success.png', title: 'Success', text: 'See my notification' });
});
```

##### nodom_wrap

If you don't want to wrap `jQuery.gritter.add({` inside a `jQuery(function()` then include the argument `:nodom_wrap`

The modified `add_gritter` helper with `nodom_wrap` looks like this:
 
```ruby
<%= add_gritter(:success, "See my notification", :nodom_wrap => true )%>
```

With `:nodom_wrap` included, the following JQuery code will be produced.

```js
jQuery.gritter.add({
  image: '/assets/success.png',
  title: 'Success',
  text: 'The product has been created successfully!'
}); 
```

The argument can be included in `gflash` helper as well.

```ruby
gflash :nodom_wrap => true
```
